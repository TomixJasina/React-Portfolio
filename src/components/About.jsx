			<h4 className='text-white my-5'>Hey there! I'm Tomasz Jasinski, and I'm on an exhilarating journey to become a web developer. 
                Currently midway through a transformative bootcamp course, I'm diving deep into the dynamic world of web development, driven by an insatiable curiosity and a passion to create meaningful digital experiences. 
                While I might not have a professional background in web development, my enthusiasm and dedication are unwavering. 
                What I lack in experience, I make up for with an insatiable hunger to learn, grow, and innovate in this ever-evolving field. 
                My journey into the world of coding is interwoven with my diverse interests, which significantly shape my approach to development.
